# MEA_converter
 Converts MATLAB MEA format to csvs
 
 This simple script is part of a proof of principle experiment.
 It should run with a newish version of MATLAB or Octave although it does need the newish function cell2mat.

It was tested with the same MEA data on this site, exported with MEAnalyser.
